-=TERRAIN MAPS=-

HOW TO USE:
By default, the program is set to rotate as well as capture the first 300 frames of motion.
You can use the mouse as well as keyboard keys to change the specifications of the terrain.

Left Mouse Click = Rotation
CTRL + Left Mouse Click = Translation
SHFT + Left Mouse Click = Scale

Once you activate manual deformation, the rotation animation will stop.
If the program hasn't completed the 300 frames before this point, it will then capture your manual deformations.
Any actions done after the 300 frames have been printed will not appear in the animation.

You can also change the type of display the terrain map uses.
If you right click, the menu will open up and you can select different options.
Exit is also included in this menu.
